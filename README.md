Predicting future time series values is one of the most difficult problems in the industry. The time series field encompasses many different issues, ranging from inference and analysis to forecasting and classification. Predicting the website traffic would help the website owners to scale their website and prevent outages. They can predict their server usage beforehand and can spend on it wisely.
